## 24 Hour Burger

This app was made to gain skills and knowledge with understanding how to make and ORM and utilize heroku's database cloud system.
I enjoyed putting my own spin on the fact a magical tavern sells these multi-dimensional burgers. 
I can't wait to see the crazy burgers that can be thought up.

# PesudoCode Creation

Started by installing all the NPM Packages I needed then used setup the server and connection files
Made the model then the DB schema with seeds. Setup the ORM framework then made sure the connection worked before adding them to an object.
Also created the public folder with the assets folder that contained css,images and js file.
Revamped the handlebars files to make the HTML avaliable and added jquery bootstrap and the js file for functionality.
Tampered with the CSS then used the burger-block code to display the burgers on the display.
Saved the files to git then added it to heroku and then added the database functionality to the JAWS_DB Add-On
